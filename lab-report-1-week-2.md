_Remotely Connecting_

Open new vsCode terminal using conbtrol + shift + a backtick. Connect to the remote to the remote computer using the command $ ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu where zz is the letters in your account. Go to [Account Lookup](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) to find it. It will ask a question if it is your first time connecting, type "yes" but feel free to find more details on this here: [explanation](https://superuser.com/questions/421074/ssh-the-authenticity-of-host-host-cant-be-established/421084#421084). It will also ask for a password. Here's a screenshot of me remotely connecting:
